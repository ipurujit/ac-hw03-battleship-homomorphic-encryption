# Homomorphic encryption Battleship game improvements

> Solution documentation is provided in the [README.md](./README.md) file.


In this assignment, you need to implement a full Battleship board 10x10 matrix
and each player has 5 boats with sizes of 5, 4, 3, 2 and 2 dots
using homomorphic encryption to hide the board information.

Also, instead of just Alice setting up a board and Bob guessing,
you need to implement a version where they both have their own boards,
and guess by taking turns, until there is a winner of the game.

Submission:

Submit your full game as a public github repository link.
